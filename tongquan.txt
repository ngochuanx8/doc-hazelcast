1. Tổng quan về Hazelcast:
- Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform
- Store and process your data in RAM
- Hazelcast is implemented in Java language 	
- It is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients
- You can request data, listen to events, submit data processing tasks using Hazelcast clients connected to a cluster
- You can build data pipelines using SQL or the Java API which enable the data to flow from an application to a data source or from a data source to an analytics database
- You can import data from databases, files, messaging systems, on-premise and cloud systems in various formats (data ingestion).
- You can run queries on the data using SQL in your maps or external systems like Apache Kafka.
- You can run computational tasks on different cluster members (distributed computing)
- You can store your data using the distributed implementation of various data structures like maps, caches, queues, topics, concurrency utilities
- You can have multiple Hazelcast clusters at different locations in sync by replicating their state over WAN environments
- You can listen to the events happening in the cluster, on the data structures and clients so that you are notified when those events happen.
